# "Weight Wise" Weight Tracker Android App

A mobile application built in Android Studio as part of my Mobile Architecture and Programming course at Southern New Hampshire University.
The app allows users to log their weight, set personal goals, and visually track progress over time. It's designed with a clean, user-friendly interface and persistent local storage using SQLite.

## Features

- ✅ Add and track weight entries
- ✅ Set and update personal weight goals
- ✅ View weight history and progress difference
- ✅ Local data storage using SQLite
- ✅ Log-in/Register account
